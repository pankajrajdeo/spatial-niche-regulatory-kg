# How to Calibrate LLM-as-Judge with Human Corrections

**Key Takeaways**

- To build an evaluator you can trust for shipping decisions, you need systematic alignment to human corrections. Prompt iteration alone won't close the gap between a technically correct evaluator and a reliable one.
- LangSmith's Align Evals feature replaces prompt-guessing with a measurable loop: collect human corrections, build few-shot examples, and track agreement over time.
- Teams that collect human corrections, build few-shot examples, and track agreement metrics get automated scores they can use to make shipping decisions with confidence.

Early on, developers wrote rubrics and configured LLM judges hoping the scores would hold, but they didn't. Running evaluators in production has taught us that the evaluator prompt directly determines trustworthiness. Getting the prompt right requires systematic alignment to human preferences through deliberate iteration, not intuition.

You need a reliable operational workflow to configure LLM judges and align them to human feedback. Running these judges in production helps you build a data flywheel. Production traces feed your[AI observability](https://www.langchain.com/resources/ai-observability) layer, which surfaces usage pattern insights. Those insights inform datasets. Datasets power evaluations. Evaluations drive improvements. Improvements generate better new traces, and the cycle continues.

## What is LLM-as-a-judge?

LLM-as-a-judge uses a large language model (LLM) to evaluate AI agent outputs as a scalable substitute for human judgment. Traditional NLP metrics measure surface-level text similarity. An LLM judge assesses qualities that actually matter to your users, like helpfulness, accuracy, and tone.

The core idea is straightforward. You give an LLM a prompt describing what "good" looks like alongside the output you want to evaluate. The model returns a score or judgment. LLMs handle evaluating text well when you give them clear criteria because it's a focused classification task, not an open-ended generation problem.

These evaluators have become the practical default for teams building AI agents. Traditional metrics cannot measure whether an agent followed instructions, avoided hallucinations, or maintained the right tone across a conversation. An LLM judge assesses these qualities across thousands of traces to provide nuanced feedback that would otherwise require expensive human review.

## Why LLM-as-a-judge provides reliable evaluations

Evaluating text is fundamentally easier than generating it. When your LLM generates a response, it navigates an enormous space of possible outputs while maintaining coherence, accuracy, and relevance. When that same model evaluates a response, it performs a simpler task. Instead of generating new content, the model compares the output against specific criteria and makes a judgment.

An external LLM with a dedicated evaluation prompt performs a different task than the original generation process. Instead of generating creative content, the judge applies a rubric to assess quality. When you add chain-of-thought reasoning to the evaluation prompt, the judge can articulate its scoring rationale. This makes disagreements easier to diagnose. The separation between generation and evaluation means you can use the same model family for both tasks while still getting a useful signal.

[Academic benchmarks](https://www.langchain.com/resources/llm-evaluation-benchmarks) like MT-Bench report that strong LLM judges reach 80% agreement with human evaluators, which is roughly the level of agreement humans reach with each other. This makes LLM-as-a-judge viable for many evaluation tasks. Your specific agreement rate will depend heavily on how well the evaluator prompt captures what "good" means for your use case.

## Types of LLM judges

LLM judges fall into three main approaches, each answering a different evaluation question. Your choice depends on what you need to measure.

###### LLM Judge Approaches

| Judge type | How it works | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pairwise comparison | The judge sees two outputs and selects which is better according to specified criteria | Model selection, A/B testing prompts, comparing versions during development |
| Criteria-based scoring | The judge scores a single output against defined dimensions (helpfulness, accuracy, tone) | Continuous quality monitoring, [regression testing](../langsmith/evaluation-concepts.md), production evaluation |
| [Reference-based evaluation](../langsmith/llm-as-judge.md) | The judge compares the output against source documents or ground truth | RAG faithfulness checking, detecting hallucinations, grounding verification. |

- Pairwise comparisons produce more reliable results than absolute scoring because the judge makes a relative decision rather than calibrating to an abstract scale.
- Criteria-based scoring works better for production monitoring where you need to evaluate every output individually.
- Reference-based evaluation is essential for RAG systems where you must verify that responses stay faithful to retrieved documents.

Teams building chatbot experiences often combine scoring approaches to assess both individual response quality and conversation-level coherence.

## How to configure an LLM-as-a-judge evaluator

An LLM-as-a-judge evaluator is a configured instrument with four components you must deliberately engineer.

- **Evaluation prompt**: The instructions that tell the judge what to assess and how. This is where you define what "good" means for your specific use case. Many teams start from evaluator templates and customize them for their domain.
- **Model selection**: Which LLM powers the evaluation. Stronger models generally produce more reliable judgments, but cost and latency matter for production evaluation. You access the judge model through its API.
- **Variable mapping**: Which parts of the input, output, and any reference materials get passed to the evaluator. For RAG systems, this includes retrieved documents. For AI agents, this includes tool calls and intermediate reasoning.
- **Feedback configuration (the rubric)**: The scoring criteria your evaluator grades against. In[LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith-platform), feedback configuration is added as structured output to the LLM-as-a-judge prompt, which means the rubric becomes part of the engineered output schema.

### Rubric design principles

The rubric requires careful design. When you write a rubric, you are defining structured output that the LLM must produce. This means you need precision in how you specify scoring criteria. Binary or low-precision scoring produces more reliable results than high-precision numerical scales. LLMs struggle to calibrate fine-grained distinctions consistently, so simpler scoring frameworks work better in practice.

A well-designed rubric still won't guarantee alignment with human judgment. Your initial prompt is a hypothesis about what quality means for your use case. When you run that evaluator in production, you will discover edge cases and domain-specific quality dimensions you did not anticipate. Closing the gap between a technically correct prompt and an evaluator you trust for shipping decisions requires systematic alignment to human feedback.

## How to align evaluators with human feedback

Most teams get stuck iterating on rubric wording without knowing if the judge is actually improving. LangSmith's[Align Evals feature](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/tutorials/aligning_evaluator) replaces that loop with a systematic process: collect human corrections, calibrate with few-shot examples, and track agreement over time. Instead of iterating on prompts by intuition, you follow a structured process that builds confidence in your automated scores.

### Collecting human corrections

The workflow starts by collecting human annotations on evaluator scores. When your LLM judge scores a trace, human reviewers examine a sample of those judgments and correct any they disagree with. These corrections become the ground truth for measuring and improving evaluator alignment. Annotators with [domain expertise](https://www.langchain.com/resources/ai-observability) are particularly valuable for establishing baseline quality expectations.

Here is what this looks like in practice. Your LLM judge scores a customer support response as helpful, but a domain expert reviews the trace and marks it unhelpful because the response missed a critical policy detail. That correction becomes your training signal.

### Building few-shot examples

From those corrections, you build few-shot examples that calibrate the judge. Adding examples of correct judgments to the evaluator prompt helps the LLM understand the boundaries of your criteria. [Align Evals](../langsmith/improve-judge-evaluator-feedback.md) make it straightforward to select representative examples and incorporate them into your evaluator configuration.

### Measuring agreement over time

You can track how often your evaluator agrees with human experts, identify categories of disagreement, and iterate with data rather than guesswork. Instead of guessing at prompt improvements, this approach creates a measurable feedback loop. You collect human corrections on evaluator judgments, use those corrections to build calibrating few-shot examples, and track agreement metrics over time to verify improvement.

## Running LLM-as-a-judge in production

[Online evaluations](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/observability/how_to_guides/online_evaluations) give you real-time feedback on your production traces. Online evaluations differ fundamentally from offline evaluation. Offline evaluation tests against curated datasets you control. Online evaluations reveal what your AI agent actually does when users interact with it in production.

### Offline Evals: testing against curated datasets

Before your AI agent reaches production, offline evals let you validate behavior against datasets you control. You define what a correct or acceptable output looks like, build a dataset of representative examples, and run your LLM judge against them. This is where you catch obvious rubric failures before they affect users.

Offline evals work best when you have clear ground truth like a reference answer, a retrieved document, or a set of human-labeled examples to compare against. They're also the right tool for regression testing: when you change your agent's prompt or model, you run offline evals against the same dataset to confirm nothing broke.

### Online evaluations: monitoring production traffic

Online evaluations run automatically on live traffic, turning every AI agent interaction into a measurable data point. Instead of manually reviewing traces, you can systematically sample production traffic and assess quality at scale.

**Operational controls**

Production evaluation needs careful controls to balance comprehensive quality monitoring with operational efficiency.

- **Sampling rates**: Control what percentage of production traces trigger evaluation. This makes continuous evaluation cost-effective, even at high volumes. You can evaluate every trace or sample strategically based on your quality requirements and budget.
- **Retention and pricing implications**: Running an online evaluator on any run within a trace can automatically upgrade that trace to extended data retention. This affects both how long you store data and your trace pricing. Understanding this relationship helps you plan evaluation strategies that align with your data retention policies.
- **Filtering and targeting**: Define rules about which traces get evaluated. For example, you can score all customer-facing AI agent interactions while sampling internal testing traces at a lower rate. This targeted approach ensures you allocate evaluation resources where they matter most.

**Real-time quality monitoring**

Online evaluations act as a smoke detector for AI agent quality degradation. You can detect drift or emerging failure patterns in real time rather than discovering problems after user complaints. When online evaluations flag problematic traces,[LangSmith’s Insights Agent](https://blog.langchain.com/insights-agent-multiturn-evals-langsmith/) extracts usage pattern insights. You then route those insights into datasets for evals, driving improvements that generate better new traces.

### LLM-as-a-judge in the evaluation stack

Within your evals setup, LLM-as-a-judge handles the quality dimensions that deterministic checks can't reach. Deterministic rules handle format validation, length constraints, and required elements quickly and cheaply. But they cannot tell you whether your AI agent's response was actually helpful, whether it stayed on-topic across a multi-turn conversation, or whether it avoided a hallucination that technically passed a string-match check. That's where LLM-as-a-judge fits.

## Evaluating multi-turn conversations and AI agent trajectories

Production monitoring handles individual runs, but your AI agent workflows often span entire conversations. An agent that reaches the correct final answer can still have quality problems if it follows a problematic path to get there. It might call the wrong tools, execute unnecessary loops, or violate constraints during the process.

### Thread-level evaluation

Multi-turn evaluation captures whether the AI agent achieved the user's goal across the full conversation. This includes scoring semantic intent, outcomes, and trajectory. Examining the step-by-step progression reveals patterns that final-answer scoring misses.

LangSmith supports[multi-turn online evaluators](../langsmith/online-evaluations-multi-turn.md) that run once a thread completes. Your LLM-as-a-judge prompt can assess the complete interaction rather than individual turns in isolation.

### System-level behavior patterns

Thread-level evaluation reveals patterns that run-level scoring misses. An AI agent handling individual turns well can still struggle with context switching, memory management, or multi-step reasoning. Evaluating the full trajectory gives you a signal on these system-level behaviors, which is why multi-turn evaluation matters for AI agent quality.

## Known biases and limitations with LLM-as-a-judge

LLM judges have well-documented biases that can compromise score reliability. Aligning your evaluator to human judgment is more important than simply choosing the right evaluation protocol. Calibration is the mechanism that helps you overcome these inherent biases and build evaluators you can trust.

###### LLM Judge Approaches

| Bias type | What happens | How to mitigate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Position bias | In pairwise comparison, the judge favors outputs presented in certain positions (first or last) | Randomize presentation order; run evaluations in both orders and check consistency |
| Verbosity bias | Longer responses get higher scores regardless of actual quality | Add explicit rubric instructions about conciseness; use length-controlled evaluation protocols |
| Self-enhancement bias | Models score their own outputs higher than outputs from other models | Use a different model for evaluation than generation when possible |
| Provenance / recency bias | Judges favor certain stylistic patterns or phrasing associated with recent training data | Calibrate against human judgments from your specific domain |

A judge that correlates well with your human experts has been calibrated past these raw biases. An unvalidated judge might measure verbosity rather than whether the output is high-quality and genuinely helpful.

Score inconsistency across evaluation modes also matters.[Research shows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14716) that the same judge can produce contradictory results depending on whether you ask it to score outputs individually or compare them side by side. A judge might even violate transitivity, preferring output A over B, B over C, but then C over A. Systematic alignment to human feedback catches these inconsistencies before they affect your decisions.

## When to use LLM judges versus alternatives

LLM-as-a-judge works best as part of your hybrid evaluation stack. Different evaluation methods suit different quality dimensions in AI agents.

- **LLM-based judges**: Use these for nuanced quality assessment where "good" requires judgment. They measure helpfulness, accuracy, appropriate tone, and whether the AI agent actually solved the user's problem.
- **Deterministic rules**: Use these for obvious issues like format validation, length constraints, or the presence of required elements. Rules are fast, cheap, and perfectly reliable for what they measure. Use them as your first pass.
- **Human evaluation through Annotation Queues**: Use human evaluation when expert judgment is irreplaceable. High-stakes domains like medical, legal, or product decision contexts require this level of scrutiny. Human evaluation also plays a critical role in creating golden datasets and validating that your evaluators align with expert expectations.[LangSmith's Annotation Queues](../langsmith/annotation-queues.md) make it straightforward to route traces to the right reviewers and collect structured feedback at scale.
- **Traditional metrics**: Apply these for structured tasks with a reference answer. If you have ground truth, semantic similarity or an exact match is sufficient. Don't use an LLM judge when a simpler metric gives you the same signal.

Product managers, clinicians, lawyers, and analysts working with AI agents each bring domain expertise that automated evaluation cannot fully replace. The goal is scaling human judgment to handle production volumes while keeping experts involved where their input matters most.

## The data flywheel: from production traces to improved evaluators

LangSmith connects a data flywheel where production data fuels testing and evaluation improvement. This cycle transforms every production interaction into an improvement signal for your AI agents. It connects observability, evaluation, and iteration into a single continuous workflow.

### How the flywheel works

Production traces reveal real-world AI agent behavior. The [Insights Agent](../langsmith/insights.md) analyzes these traces to surface usage pattern insights. Route problematic traces into datasets with a single click, turning them into regression tests. Human corrections on evaluator scores improve alignment. Better-aligned evaluators give you more trustworthy signals for the next round of improvements. Each cycle through this loop makes your evaluators more trustworthy and generates better new traces.

### Shipping faster with production observation

Teams can ship faster by relying on production observation as their primary learning method rather than conducting extensive pre-testing followed by anxious launches. This approach allows problems to surface through systematic evaluation in real time. Instead of waiting for user complaints to identify issues, teams detect and address quality concerns as they emerge through continuous monitoring. This shift transforms how teams think about quality assurance: rather than trying to anticipate every possible failure mode before launch, they build the instrumentation to catch and fix problems quickly in production. The result is faster iteration cycles and more confident shipping decisions.

## Build evaluators you can trust

LLM-as-a-judge becomes reliable when you treat it as production code requiring ongoing calibration and validation.

LangSmith brings this operational model together. LangSmith is framework-agnostic and works with the LangChain framework, LangGraph, Deep Agents, or any other stack you're building with. The Align Evals feature gives you a structured process for tuning judges to human preferences. Online evaluations provide real-time quality monitoring on production traces. Annotation Queues keep human expertise in the loop where it matters most.
