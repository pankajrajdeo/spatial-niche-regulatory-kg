# LangSmith Deployment

> Deploy and manage agents with durable execution, real-time streaming, and horizontal scaling.

**LangSmith Deployment** is a workflow orchestration runtime purpose-built for agent workloads. It provides the managed infrastructure agents need to run reliably in production at scale, supporting the full lifecycle from local development to deployment. Deploy to Cloud, BYOC, or your own infrastructure.

> [!NOTE]
> This page covers how your **agents** run in production with **LangSmith Deployment**.
>
> Where you run LangSmith for observability, evaluation, and prompt engineering is separate; refer to [Platform setup](langsmith/platform-setup.md) for details.

## Deployable products

LangSmith Deployment is framework-agnostic which means you can deploy agents built with:

#### [LangGraph (and LangChain)](langsmith/deployment-quickstart.md)
Use the LangGraph CLI and app templates to deploy an application to LangSmith.

#### [Google ADK](langsmith/deploy-google-adk.md)
Deploy Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) agent as a LangGraph with the `deployments-wrap-sdk` package.

#### [Other frameworks](langsmith/deploy-other-frameworks.md)
Deploy Claude Agent SDK, Strands, CrewAI, AutoGen, and other agent frameworks with the Functional API or `deployments-wrap-sdk`.

#### [Looking to deploy Deep Agents?](langsmith/python/managed-deep-agents-overview.md)
Use Managed Deep Agents: the managed runtime for deploying code-first Deep Agents.

## LangSmith Deployment environments

Pick an environment based on where you want the [control plane](langsmith/control-plane.md) and [data plane](langsmith/data-plane.md) (Agent Servers and their databases) to run. All infrastructure types use the same [Agent Server](langsmith/agent-server.md) runtime.

#### [Cloud](langsmith/deploy-to-cloud-overview.md)
Fully managed by LangChain on AWS and GCP. Create deployments from GitHub in the LangSmith UI or with [`langgraph deploy`](langsmith/cli.md#deploy). Requires a [Plus plan or above](https://www.langchain.com/pricing).

#### [Self-hosted with control plane](langsmith/deploy-with-control-plane.md)
Run the LangSmith Deployment control plane and Agent Servers in your own Kubernetes cluster, alongside self-hosted LangSmith. Requires the [Enterprise plan](https://www.langchain.com/pricing) with LangSmith Deployment enabled.

#### [Hybrid](langsmith/hybrid.md)
LangChain-managed control plane with Agent Servers and their data plane in your infrastructure. Traces flow to LangSmith Cloud or self-hosted LangSmith.

#### [Standalone server](langsmith/deploy-standalone-server.md)
Deploy Agent Server with Docker, Compose, or Kubernetes. Bring your own PostgreSQL, Redis, and LangSmith license; no control plane. Optional [LangSmith tracing](langsmith/observability.md) to Cloud or a self-hosted instance.

## Common setups

* **Managed hosting for your agents.** LangSmith Deployment on [Cloud](langsmith/deploy-to-cloud-overview.md). LangChain hosts the control plane, data plane, and databases. Pairs with LangSmith Cloud.
* **Agents in your VPC, control plane managed.** LangSmith Deployment via [Hybrid](langsmith/hybrid.md). LangChain hosts the control plane; you host Agent Servers and their data plane. Pairs with LangSmith Cloud or self-hosted LangSmith.
* **Full data residency or air-gapped.** [Self-hosted LangSmith Deployment](langsmith/deploy-with-control-plane.md). You host the control plane and Agent Servers in your own infrastructure alongside self-hosted LangSmith.
* **Agent runtime only, no control plane.** [Standalone Agent Server](langsmith/deploy-standalone-server.md). Run Agent Server containers with Docker or Kubernetes without a control plane, optionally sending traces to LangSmith Cloud or self-hosted.

For where the LangSmith platform runs, see [Platform setup](langsmith/platform-setup.md).

## After deployment

Once deployed, agents work with [Agent Server](langsmith/assistants.md)'s execution model: **assistants** for configuration, **threads** for state, and **runs** for workloads. For capabilities, tutorials, server customization, and operations, see [Agent Server](langsmith/develop-agents-overview.md).

#### [Update prompts and contexts without redeploying](langsmith/prompt-context-hub.md)
Manage the prompts and versioned contexts your deployed agents pull at runtime, so you can change behavior without a full deploy.

#### [Interact with your deployment using RemoteGraph](langsmith/use-remote-graph.md)
Call your deployed graph from client code as if it were a local compiled graph.

#### [Find and fix failures with Engine](langsmith/engine-overview.md)
Once agents are in production, use LangSmith Engine to detect recurring failures in their traces, diagnose root causes, and resolve them.

## Full-stack web apps

Ship a LangChain.js agent and chat UI together as a single web app. The Vite example uses LangSmith Deployment as the agent backend behind a separate UI. Other examples embed the agent inside the web framework's route handlers and ship to the host platform.

#### [Full-stack web apps](langsmith/deploy-frameworks-and-platforms.md)
Ship a LangChain.js chat app: embed the agent in Next.js, SvelteKit, Nuxt, Cloudflare Workers, or Deno Deploy (no Agent Server required), or pair LangSmith Deployment with a Vite + React UI.
