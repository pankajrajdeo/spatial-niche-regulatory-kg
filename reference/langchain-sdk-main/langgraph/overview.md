# LangGraph overview

> Gain control with LangGraph to design agents that reliably handle complex tasks

Trusted by companies shaping the future of agents—including Klarna, Uber, J.P. Morgan, and more—LangGraph is a low-level orchestration framework and runtime for building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents. LangGraph gives you fine-grained control to mix deterministic, hand-coded steps with LLM-driven agentic steps in the same graph, so you can build bespoke agents that behave exactly the way your application requires.

LangGraph is very low-level, and focused entirely on agent **orchestration**. Before using LangGraph, we recommend you familiarize yourself with some of the components used to build agents, starting with [models](../langchain/models.md) and [tools](../langchain/tools.md).

We will commonly use [LangChain](../langchain/overview.md) components throughout the documentation to integrate models and tools, but you don't need to use LangChain to use LangGraph. If you are just getting started with agents or want a higher-level abstraction, we recommend you use LangChain's [agents](../langchain/agents.md) that provide prebuilt architectures for common LLM and tool-calling loops.

LangGraph is focused on the underlying capabilities important for agent orchestration: durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, and more.

One of LangGraph's core strengths is the ability to mix deterministic steps with LLM-driven agentic steps in a single graph. This lets you build bespoke workflows where parts of the logic are fully predictable and auditable while other parts are flexible and model-driven, giving you fine-grained control over exactly where and how AI is applied.

**how LangChain products fit together**
* [Deep Agents](../deepagents/overview.md) is an [agent harness](../concepts/products.md#agent-harnesses-like-the-deep-agents-sdk): planning, subagents, filesystem tools, and context management on top of LangGraph.
* [LangChain](../langchain/overview.md) is the agent framework: abstractions and integrations for models, tools, and agent loops.
* [LangGraph](overview.md) is the orchestration runtime: durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, and persistence.
* [LangSmith](../langsmith/observability.md) is the platform for tracing, evaluation, prompts, and deployment across frameworks.
* [LangSmith Engine](../langsmith/engine.md) detects issues in your LangGraph agent traces and proposes fixes. You can open a pull request with the proposed fix directly from the Engine tab.
* [LangSmith Fleet](../langsmith/fleet/index.md) is the no-code agent builder for templates, integrations, and routine automation.

Read [Frameworks, runtimes, and harnesses](../concepts/products.md) for a comparison of the open source stack.

##  Install

**pip**

```bash
pip install -U langgraph
```

**uv**

```bash
uv add langgraph
```

Then, create a simple hello world example:

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START, END

def mock_llm(state: MessagesState):
    return {"messages": [{"role": "ai", "content": "hello world"}]}

graph = StateGraph(MessagesState)
graph.add_node(mock_llm)
graph.add_edge(START, "mock_llm")
graph.add_edge("mock_llm", END)
graph = graph.compile()

graph.invoke({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi!"}]})
```

> [!TIP]
> Use [LangSmith](../langsmith/observability.md) to trace requests, debug agent behavior, and evaluate outputs. Set `LANGSMITH_TRACING=true` and your API key to get started. Follow the [tracing quickstart](../langsmith/trace-with-langchain.md) to get set up.  We recommend you also set up [LangSmith Engine](../langsmith/engine.md) which monitors your traces, detects issues, and proposes fixes.

## Core benefits

LangGraph provides low-level supporting infrastructure for *any* long-running, stateful workflow or agent. LangGraph does not abstract prompts or architecture, and provides the following central benefits:

* **Mix deterministic and agentic steps**: Combine hand-coded, deterministic logic with LLM-driven decision-making in a single graph. Use deterministic steps where you need reliability and predictability, and agentic steps where you need flexibility—giving you precise control over every part of your agent's behavior.
* [Persistence](persistence.md): Build agents that persist through failures and can run for extended periods, resuming from where they left off.
* [Human-in-the-loop](interrupts.md): Incorporate human oversight by inspecting and modifying agent state at any point.
* [Comprehensive memory](../concepts/memory.md): Create stateful agents with both short-term working memory for ongoing reasoning and long-term memory across sessions.
* [Debugging with LangSmith](../langsmith/observability.md): Gain deep visibility into complex agent behavior with visualization tools that trace execution paths, capture state transitions, and provide detailed runtime metrics.
* [Production-ready deployment](../langsmith/deployment.md): Deploy sophisticated agent systems confidently with scalable infrastructure designed to handle the unique challenges of stateful, long-running workflows.

## LangGraph ecosystem

While LangGraph can be used standalone, it also integrates seamlessly with any LangChain product, giving developers a full suite of tools for building agents. To improve your LLM application development, pair LangGraph with:

#### [LangSmith Observability](../langsmith/observability.md)
Trace requests, evaluate outputs, and monitor deployments in one place. Prototype locally with LangGraph, then move to production with integrated observability and evaluation to build more reliable agent systems.

#### [LangSmith Deployment](../langsmith/deployment.md)
Deploy and scale agents effortlessly with a purpose-built deployment platform for long running, stateful workflows. Discover, reuse, configure, and share agents across teams — and iterate quickly with visual prototyping in Studio.

#### [LangChain](../langchain/overview.md)
Provides integrations and composable components to streamline LLM application development. Contains agent abstractions built on top of LangGraph.
