# IBM integrations

> Integrate with IBM using LangChain Python.

LangChain integrations related to IBM technologies, including the
[IBM watsonx.ai](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai) platform and DB2 database.

## Watsonx AI

IBM® watsonx.ai™ AI studio is part of the IBM [watsonx](https://www.ibm.com/watsonx)™ AI and data platform, bringing together new generative
AI capabilities powered by [foundation models](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai/foundation-models) and traditional machine learning (ML)
into a powerful studio spanning the AI lifecycle. Tune and guide models with your enterprise data to meet your needs with easy-to-use tools for
building and refining performant prompts. With watsonx.ai, you can build AI applications in a fraction of the time and with a fraction of the data.
Watsonx.ai offers:

* **Multi-model variety and flexibility:** Choose from IBM-developed, open-source and third-party models, or build your own model.
* **Differentiated client protection:** IBM stands behind IBM-developed models and indemnifies the client against third-party IP claims.
* **End-to-end AI governance:** Enterprises can scale and accelerate the impact of AI with trusted data across the business, using data wherever it resides.
* **Hybrid, multi-cloud deployments:** IBM provides the flexibility to integrate and deploy your AI workloads into your hybrid-cloud stack of choice.

## DB2

The IBM DB2 relational database v12.1.2 and above offers the abilities of vector store
and vector search. Installation of `langchain-db2` package will give LangChain users
the support of DB2 vector store and vector search.

> [!NOTE]
> `langchain-db2` is a separate package for Vector Store feature only, and can be run without the `langchain-ibm` package.

### Vector stores

#### [DB2VS](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-ibm/tree/main/libs/langchain-db2)
IBM DB2 Vector Store and Vector Search
