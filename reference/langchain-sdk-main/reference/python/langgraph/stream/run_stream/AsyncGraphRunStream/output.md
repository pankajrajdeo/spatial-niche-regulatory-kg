# output

> **Method** in `langgraph`

📖 [View in docs](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/stream/run_stream/AsyncGraphRunStream/output)

Drive the run to completion and return the final state.

Methods (not properties) on the async lane so `run.output`
without `await` raises at type-check time instead of silently
yielding a coroutine object.

## Signature

```python
output(
    self,
) -> dict[str, Any] | None
```

## Description

**Example:**

```python
output = await run.output()
```
