# DEFAULT_SUMMARY_PROMPT

> **Attribute** in `langchain`

📖 [View in docs](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/agents/middleware/summarization/DEFAULT_SUMMARY_PROMPT)

Default prompt used to summarize conversation history.

The `<messages>` marker (on its own line) and the `{messages}` placeholder are
part of this constant's public contract, not just cosmetic formatting.
Downstream consumers depend on them: for example, deep agents'
`SummarizationMiddleware` splices an extra instruction block in immediately
before the `<messages>` marker via `str.replace`. Removing, renaming, or
reformatting the marker (or the `{messages}` placeholder) is a breaking change
for those consumers even though it does not alter any function signature, so
treat edits to it accordingly.

## Signature

```python
DEFAULT_SUMMARY_PROMPT = '<role>\nContext Extraction Assistant\n</role>\n\n<primary_objective>\nYour sole objective in this task is to extract the highest quality/most relevant context from the conversation history below.\n</primary_objective>\n\n<objective_information>\nYou\'re nearing the total number of input tokens you can accept, so you must extract the highest quality/most relevant pieces of information from your conversation history.\nThis context will then overwrite the conversation history presented below. Because of this, ensure the context you extract is only the most important information to continue working toward your overall goal.\n</objective_information>\n\n<instructions>\nThe conversation history below will be replaced with the context you extract in this step.\nYou want to ensure that you don\'t repeat any actions you\'ve already completed, so the context you extract from the conversation history should be focused on the most important information to your overall goal.\n\nYou should structure your summary using the following sections. Each section acts as a checklist - you must populate it with relevant information or explicitly state "None" if there is nothing to report for that section:\n\n## SESSION INTENT\n\nWhat is the user\'s primary goal or request? What overall task are you trying to accomplish? This should be concise but complete enough to understand the purpose of the entire session.\n\n## SUMMARY\n\nExtract and record all of the most important context from the conversation history. Include important choices, conclusions, or strategies determined during this conversation. Include the reasoning behind key decisions. Document any rejected options and why they were not pursued.\n\n## ARTIFACTS\n\nWhat artifacts, files, or resources were created, modified, or accessed during this conversation? For file modifications, list specific file paths and briefly describe the changes made to each. This section prevents silent loss of artifact information.\n\n## NEXT STEPS\n\nWhat specific tasks remain to be completed to achieve the session intent? What should you do next?\n\n</instructions>\n\nThe user will message you with the full message history from which you\'ll extract context to create a replacement. Carefully read through it all and think deeply about what information is most important to your overall goal and should be saved:\n\nWith all of this in mind, please carefully read over the entire conversation history, and extract the most important and relevant context to replace it so that you can free up space in the conversation history.\nRespond ONLY with the extracted context. Do not include any additional information, or text before or after the extracted context.\n\n<messages>\nMessages to summarize:\n{messages}\n</messages>'
