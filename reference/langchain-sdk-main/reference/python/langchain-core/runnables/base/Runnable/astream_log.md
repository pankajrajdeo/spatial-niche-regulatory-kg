# astream_log

> **Method** in `langchain_core`

📖 [View in docs](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain-core/runnables/base/Runnable/astream_log)

Stream all output from a `Runnable`, as reported to the callback system.

This includes all inner runs of LLMs, Retrievers, Tools, etc.

Output is streamed as Log objects, which include a list of
Jsonpatch ops that describe how the state of the run has changed in each
step, and the final state of the run.

The Jsonpatch ops can be applied in order to construct state.

## Signature

```python
astream_log(
    self,
    input: Any,
    config: RunnableConfig | None = None,
    *,
    diff: bool = True,
    with_streamed_output_list: bool = True,
    include_names: Sequence[str] | None = None,
    include_types: Sequence[str] | None = None,
    include_tags: Sequence[str] | None = None,
    exclude_names: Sequence[str] | None = None,
    exclude_types: Sequence[str] | None = None,
    exclude_tags: Sequence[str] | None = None,
    **kwargs: Any = {},
) -> AsyncIterator[RunLogPatch] | AsyncIterator[RunLog]
```
