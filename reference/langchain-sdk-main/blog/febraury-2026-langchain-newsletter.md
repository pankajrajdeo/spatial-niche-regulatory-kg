**Production monitoring for agents**
Traditional monitoring tools weren't built for agents. Their infinite input space, non-deterministic outputs, and multi-step reasoning chains require a different approach entirely.

We broke down what production observability for agents actually looks like, and what we've learned from teams deploying at scale. [Read the full piece.](https://www.langchain.com/conceptual-guides/production-monitoring?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-97KERjwtEwc832AmNU8y5gNmj3XBly2OHhdZRpzmFkqJBT-_41P-uLU9VGgBiR9eOUo7SL)

**Improving Deep Agents with harness engineering**
Our coding agent jumped from Top 30 to Top 5 on Terminal Bench 2.0, without touching the model. The secret was harness engineering: self-verification loops, loop detection middleware, and using LangSmith traces as a feedback signal to systematically debug failure modes at scale. [Read how we did it.](https://blog.langchain.com/improving-deep-agents-with-harness-engineering/?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-97KERjwtEwc832AmNU8y5gNmj3XBly2OHhdZRpzmFkqJBT-_41P-uLU9VGgBiR9eOUo7SL)

**Tracing in LangSmith is as easy as copy/paste**
Get started in seconds with Claude Agent SDK, OpenAI, LangChain, Vercel AI SDK, and 20+ other frameworks. Pick your stack, copy the code, start debugging. [Get started here.](../langsmith/integrations.md)

**LangChain Academy course: Building reliable agents**
Learn how to take an agent from first run to production-ready system through iterative cycles of improvement. You’ll learn how to do this with LangSmith, our agent engineering platform for observing and evaluating agents. [Enroll for free in the new course.](https://academy.langchain.com/courses/building-reliable-agents?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-97KERjwtEwc832AmNU8y5gNmj3XBly2OHhdZRpzmFkqJBT-_41P-uLU9VGgBiR9eOUo7SL)

### 🤝 Customer story highlight

monday.com Service sped up their evals feedback loop nearly 9x by making evals a day 0 requirement using LangSmith.
