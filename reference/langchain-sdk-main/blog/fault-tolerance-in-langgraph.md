# Fault Tolerance in LangGraph: Retries, Timeouts, and Error Handlers

In the real world, agents hit errors that prototypes never see: network failures, tool call errors, LLM rate limits.

Imagine you have a task that's been running for hours or days that hits an unrecoverable error halfway through. What do you do? Abandon the run and completely start over? This isn’t a sustainable way to run production agents.

Writing the happy path is usually the easy part. The error handling boilerplate that makes it survive in production (retries, timeouts, fallbacks) is often longer than the business logic itself.

[LangGraph](../langgraph/overview.md) models your agent as a set of discrete steps (nodes), organized as a graph. For a typical agent, that's a node that calls the model, a node that runs any tool calls it returns, and any deterministic logic you want to wrap around that loop. Because LangGraph controls execution, it's also where you handle what happens when any of those steps fail.

This post walks through the three primitives LangGraph gives you for [fault tolerance](../langgraph/fault-tolerance.md), how they compose, and why having them inside the workflow engine matters once you start thinking about compensation logic.

The three primitives are:

1. [`RetryPolicy`](../langgraph/fault-tolerance.md#retries): automatic retries with backoff/jitter for transient errors.
2. [`TimeoutPolicy`](../langgraph/fault-tolerance.md#timeouts): a wall-clock or progress-based cap on a node attempt.
3. [`error_handler`](../langgraph/fault-tolerance.md#error-handling): a node that runs **after retries are exhausted**, with the failure context attached.

In LangGraph, you define your agent by adding nodes and edges to a `StateGraph`. All three primitives attach directly to a node via [`add_node`](../langgraph/fault-tolerance.md#retries), so your fault tolerance config lives right next to the logic it protects. (If you want to configure defaults once, see [`set_node_defaults`](../langgraph/fault-tolerance.md#graph-defaults).)`‍`

```
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langgraph.types import RetryPolicy, TimeoutPolicy
from langgraph.errors import NodeError

(
    StateGraph(State)
    .add_node(
        "call_llm",
        call_llm,
        retry_policy=RetryPolicy(max_attempts=4, backoff_factor=2.0),
        timeout=TimeoutPolicy(run_timeout=30, idle_timeout=5),
        error_handler=handle_model_failure,
    )
    ...
)
```

## Starting from retries

Transient failures are the most common kind of failure in any non-trivial graph: an LLM provider returns a 5xx, a vector store hits a connection reset, a downstream HTTP service is briefly unavailable. Every one of these is fundamentally a “try again in a moment and it’ll probably work” kind of error.

Without first-class support you end up writing the same wrapper inside every node:

```
def call_llm(state):
    # ~25 lines of "retry with backoff, but only on 5xx,
    # don't retry on 4xx, log each attempt, sleep with jitter"
    ...
```

LangGraph’s RetryPolicy removes that boilerplate. It applies *per node attempt*, with exponential backoff, optional jitter, and a configurable predicate for which exceptions count as retryable:

```
from langgraph.types import RetryPolicy

policy = RetryPolicy(
    initial_interval=0.5,
    backoff_factor=2.0,
    max_interval=128.0,
    max_attempts=3,
    jitter=True,
    retry_on=(ConnectionError, TimeoutError),  # or a callable
)
```

The default `retry_on` is intentionally conservative: it retries `ConnectionError`, 5xx responses from `httpx`/`requests`, and a few generic transient categories.

By default it **does not** retry `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `RuntimeError`, etc., which are almost always programming bugs.

The `retry_on` spec can be a collection of error types **or** a callable that checks an error at runtime to see if it matches retry criteria.

## Timeout: a special case of “transient failure”

A timeout is really just “the attempt is treated as a transient failure because it’s been hanging too long.” Without an explicit timeout, a stuck HTTP call or a frozen subprocess can hang a graph run indefinitely.

LangGraph’s [`TimeoutPolicy`](../langgraph/fault-tolerance.md#timeouts) supports two types of timeouts:`‍`

```
from langgraph.types import TimeoutPolicy

TimeoutPolicy(
    run_timeout=30.0,    # hard wall-clock cap on a single attempt
    idle_timeout=5.0,    # max time without observable progress
    refresh_on="auto",   # or "heartbeat"
)
```

- ‍`run_timeout` is a hard wall-clock cap on a single attempt. Useful when you simply do not care to ever wait more than N seconds for a node.

- `idle_timeout` resets on every “progress” signal: channel writes, streamed chunks (automatically emitted from LangChain LLM models), child task events, LangChain callback events. Long-running but actively-streaming work doesn’t trip it, but a *truly* hung call does.

  - Internally, it relies on “heartbeat” for every signal. If you control the work and emit your own progress beats, you can switch to `refresh_on="heartbeat"` and explicitly call `runtime.heartbeat()` from inside the node.

When a timeout fires, the node attempt is cancelled and a [`NodeTimeoutError`](../langgraph/fault-tolerance.md#nodetimeouterror) is raised.

## Error handlers: when retries aren’t enough

Retries handle “this will probably work in 5 seconds.” However, they don’t handle the cases where retry exhaustion and you need to run some logic. For example, “we’ve tried six times, the payment provider is still down, and now you need to:

- mark the order as failed and notify the customer, or
- roll back the partial side effects we already committed, or
- publish a `payment.failed` event for the rest of the system to react to.”

There are a lot of use cases for error handlers after retry exhaustion. This includes cleanup, alerting, dead-letter writes, fallback paths to a cheaper model, or just routing to a “we apologize” message.

In LangGraph, this is now supported naturally (docs: [Error handling](../langgraph/fault-tolerance.md#error-handling)):`‍`

```
from langgraph.errors import NodeError

def on_call_llm_failed(state: State, error: NodeError) -> State:
    log.error("call_llm failed after retries:%s", error.error)
    return {"status": "llm_unavailable"}

  StateGraph(State)
  .add_node(
      "call_llm",
      call_llm,
      retry_policy=RetryPolicy(max_attempts=4),
      error_handler=on_call_llm_failed,
  )
```

`‍`A few things to notice about how this is wired:

**It only fires after retries are exhausted.** This is the property that makes the feature actually useful. If you want to run on every exception, you’d just need to write a `try/except` inside the node.

**The failure context is injected.** The handler can use parameter as `NodeError` to get the failing node’s name plus the exception (`error.node`, `error.error`).

**The transition is atomic.** When the original node fails, its `ERROR` write is committed to the checkpoint, and the handler task is scheduled as a new task in the same step. This is crucial in some critical processes where you can’t go back to the regular steps after entering the error-handler steps. If the host process crashes mid-handler, next time it will resume the run re-schedules the handler, not the original failing node

*The error handler runs in the same execution cycle.** When a node fails, the error handler is scheduled immediately alongside any other nodes that were already running in that step. It doesn't wait for them to finish, and they don't wait for it.

*in LangGraph, we call an “execution cycle” a “superstep”, if you’re familiar with the runtime.

**You can set a default handler for every node.** [`set_node_defaults`](../langgraph/fault-tolerance.md#graph-defaults) applies to every regular node that doesn’t specify its own, but a per-node `error_handler=` always wins.

**You can’t set another error handler for an error handler**. So you don’t get infinite-recursion behavior.

## Putting it together: fault tolerant flight booking

The three primitives above compose naturally, but their real power shows up in workflows that involve side effects: operations that change real-world state. Consider a flight booking: it's not one action, it's a sequence. Reserve a seat, process payment, issue a ticket. Each step talks to an external system. Any of them can fail.

The naive approach (just retry the whole thing) breaks down fast. If the reserving seat went through but the payment or issuing ticket fails, the reservation is stuck in a bad state . What you actually need is to retry each step individually, and if a step exhausts its retries, undo only the steps that already ran(including failed one because it’s unknown).

This is called the SAGA pattern, and it's a standard way to handle failures in distributed systems where you can't wrap everything in a single database transaction.

Here's what that looks like in LangGraph:

```
from typing import TypedDict, Annotated, Literal
import operator
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.types import Command, RetryPolicy
from langgraph.errors import NodeError

class BookingState(TypedDict, total=False):
    booking_id: str
    passenger: str
    flight: str
    seat: str  # assigned once the seat is reserved
    amount: int  # fare to charge, in minor units
    payment_ref: str  # set once payment is captured
    ticket_no: str  # set once the ticket is issued
    completed: Annotated[list[str], operator.add]  # accumulates per-step

def to_compensate(state: BookingState, error: NodeError) -> Command:
    """Route any retry-exhausted step to the compensation node."""
    return Command(
        """include the failed node"""
        update={"completed": [f"FAILED:{error.node}"]},
        goto="compensate",
    )

def reserve_seat(state) -> BookingState:
    # Call the seat-inventory service to hold a seat for this itinerary.
    ...
    return {"seat": "12A", "completed": ["reserve_seat"]}

def process_payment(state) -> BookingState:
    # Charge the fare via the payment processor while the seat is held.
    ...
    return {"payment_ref": "pay_abc123", "completed": ["process_payment"]}

def issue_ticket(state) -> BookingState:
    # Confirm the seat and issue the ticket once payment is captured.
    ...
    return {"ticket_no": "TKT-7788", "completed": ["issue_ticket"]}

def compensate(state) -> Command[Literal["__end__"]]:
    # Inspect `state["completed"]` and undo only the steps that actually ran,
    # in reverse order, to keep the booking all-or-nothing.
    if "issue_ticket" in state["completed"]:
        void_ticket(state)
    if "process_payment" in state["completed"]:
        refund_payment(state)
    if "reserve_seat" in state["completed"]:
        release_seat(state)
    return Command(goto=END)

graph = (
    StateGraph(BookingState)
    # All steps share the same retry policy and the same fallback target;
    # per-step overrides are still possible.
    .set_node_defaults(retry_policy=RETRYABLE, error_handler=to_compensate)
    .add_node("reserve_seat", reserve_seat)
    .add_node("process_payment", process_payment)
    .add_node("issue_ticket", issue_ticket)
    .add_node("compensate", compensate)
    .add_edge(START, "reserve_seat")
    .add_edge("reserve_seat", "process_payment")
    .add_edge("process_payment", "issue_ticket")
    .add_edge("issue_ticket", END)
    .compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)
)
```

What this gives you:

- Per-step backoff retries with the configured policy
- An atomic transition into `compensate` once any step's retries are exhausted
- Persistent state tracking which steps actually completed, so `compensate` only undoes what needs to revert

## Final words

Agents are taking on more autonomy, and with that comes more power to act. They're booking flights, filing tickets, executing payments, calling internal services. The actions they take are increasingly high-consequence and difficult to reverse.

That raises the bar for reliability. A 1% transient failure rate is a minor inconvenience in a demo. In a production agent with dozens of steps and real-world consequences, it compounds quickly.

`RetryPolicy`, `TimeoutPolicy`, and `error_handler` are built into LangGraph so that it’s easy to build an agent that’s resilient to all sorts of errors. All you have to do is define policies that make sense for your use case, and the LangGraph agent runtime handles the rest.

**Get started:** configure per-node retries, timeouts, and error handlers with the official [Fault tolerance docs](../langgraph/fault-tolerance.md).
