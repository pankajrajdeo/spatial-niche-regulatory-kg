# Building Self-Correcting Memory in OpenWiki

## Memory Has a Forgetting Problem

A memory system is only as good as its ability to forget.

Most discussions about agent memory focus on creating memories and making them retrievable later. Long term memory introduces another interesting problem that is often overlooked. As the source of truth changes, facts that were once correct can become stale without the memory system having any reliable way to notice. Over time, this causes the memory system to degrade due to things like memory drift and memory poisoning.

This problem is especially obvious in memory systems like OpenWiki because the source of truth is code that evolves over time. At first, a wiki might accurately describe API behavior or various features that exist, but as the code changes those behaviors and features may also change. If the documented knowledge about them doesn’t stay in sync with the code then those parts of the wiki become stale.

To make OpenWiki capable of forgetting and self-correcting, we needed a way to preserve not just what the wiki believes, but the evidence behind those beliefs. That gives OpenWiki a way to notice when the evidence supporting a claim has changed and identify what parts of the wiki may need to be revisited.

## Grounding What the Wiki Believes

The first step was to give OpenWiki a persistent record of the material factual claims it makes. This means that when the agent writes a wiki page, it must also identify the claims in that page and the evidence in code that supports them.

As an example, if the wiki says that failed tasks are retried three times by default, OpenWiki records that claim alongside the code that supports it.

```
{
  "statement": "Failed tasks are retried three times by default.",
  "evidence": [
    "repo://src/scheduler.ts#L393-L404"
  ]
}
```

‍`‍`The runtime then records a version for the supporting evidence so the claim can be validated again later. Doing this creates a link between each claim in the wiki and the code that supports it. Instead of treating the wiki as a collection of text, OpenWiki can track individual claims and the evidence they depend on.

## Knowing When Knowledge Goes Stale

Once a claim is linked to evidence, OpenWiki can detect when that evidence changes by comparing the version of the source that originally supported a claim against the version that exists. If they differ, the claim is flagged as stale.

A stale claim does not necessarily mean that the claim is wrong. It means that OpenWiki can no longer safely assume that the claim is still true without checking the source again. Many code changes do not immediately invalidate a dependent claim, but they do create a reason to reconsider it.

OpenWiki does not need to persist a separate status flag for this. The stored evidence version is enough to validate the claim’s freshness again on every update, so uncertainty remains durable until the evidence is rechecked.

## Correcting Stale Claims

Detecting stale knowledge is only useful if the system has a way to correct it.

When OpenWiki determines that a claim is stale, it can inspect the current supporting evidence and determine if the claim is true or false. If the claim remains true, OpenWiki can refresh the evidence version. If the claim is now false, the wiki content and its supporting evidence are updated together.

The important behavior is that stale claims remain stale until that verification actually takes place. Over time, this creates a self-correcting feedback loop. Changes to the source make previously trusted claims stale and that uncertainty persists until each claim is validated again. Wiki updates bring the documentation back in sync with what is true now.

This is different from just regenerating the wiki from scratch. OpenWiki persists what it already knows, tracks which claims have become stale, and corrects those claims as the source continues to evolve.

## Connecting Claims to OKF v0.2

Claims give OpenWiki an internal record of what each page believes and the versioned evidence that supports it. Open Knowledge Format (OKF) v0.2 makes the page level result portable and inspectable outside of OpenWiki.

OpenWiki projects claim evidence into each page's OKF `sources` metadata, records which producer last changed the page body with `generated`, and adds `verified` only after the page's complete claim set has been reconciled, rechecked, and persisted. The wiki's root index declares `okf_version: "0.2"`, making the Markdown bundle recognizable to other tools that consume OKF.

The creates a useful separation of responsibilities. Claims determine whether individual beliefs remain trustworthy. OKF communicates the provenance, evidence sources, and verification history of the document containing them. Detailed claims and precise evidence versions stay in OpenWiki’s sidecars, while the portable Markdown exposes a standard trust summary as part of the OKF front matter.

## How This Runs in Practice

Staleness detection runs at the start of every wiki update, before the agent does anything. The runtime walks the full claim set and compares each claim's persisted evidence version against the current source. This is a deterministic check with no model calls, so it stays fast even as the wiki accumulates thousands of claims.

The agent never sweeps the claim set itself. When it reads a page during an update, any stale claims on that page are surfaced alongside the content, and it resolves them as part of the work it is already doing: re-verify the claim and refresh its evidence, or correct the claim and the wiki text together. Anything left unresolved stays flagged for a future update rather than being silently dropped.

The practical effect is that update cost scales with how much the code changed, not with how many claims the wiki holds.

## Evaluating the Ability to Forget

To measure this, we built an evaluation that replays a code repository through a series of git commits with pre-defined checkpoints where the wiki is updated. The various commits introduce new features, changes to existing behavior, bug fixes, and reverts.

After each update, we evaluated factual claims in the wiki and classified each as being one of the following:

- Supported: the claims is backed by the code at the current checkpoint.
- Stale: the claim was accurate an earlier checkpoint, but the code has since changed and it no longer holds.
- Hallucinated: the claim was never true at any point in the repo’s history.
- Unverified: the claim can’t be confirmed or refuted against the code.

We ran the same sequence with and without the OpenWiki claims runtime.

|  | Baseline (n = 2000) | Claims (n = 2000) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Supported | 92.9% | 97.8% |
| Stale | 3.5% | 0.5% |
| Hallucinated | 0.7% | 0% |
| Unverified | 2.9% | 1.7% |

Across each update we saw that stale claims fell from 80 in the baseline to 9 with the claims runtime, while hallucinated claims fell from 15 to 0.

We also saw the self-correction behavior directly in individual runs. In one example, a code change left 17% of the wiki’s claims stale at the first checkpoint. By the next checkpoint, stale claims had returned to 0% and supported claims had recovered from 77% to 98%

| Checkpoint | Supported | Stale | Hallucinated | Unverified |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T1 | 77% | 17% | &lt;1% | 5% |
| T2 | 98% | 0% | &lt;1% | 2% |

This is the behavior we care most about. The claims runtime gives OpenWiki a way to identify when existing knowledge may no longer be trustworthy, persist that uncertainty across updates, and later correct it as the code continues to evolve.

## What Makes Memory Self-Correcting

Memory systems must have a way to say what they believe and why they believe it. More importantly, when something that was once valid becomes stale, the system must have a way to forget and self-correct.

The claims runtime gives OpenWiki that capability. Claims durably connect wiki knowledge to source evidence so that changes to the evidence flag affected claims as stale. Future wiki updates then have the ability to validate or self-correct stale claims without rebuilding the wiki from scratch.

In this model, forgetting is not all about deleting old memories. Instead, it is about knowing when a belief should no longer be trusted. This gives OpenWiki a way to proactively forget and evolve with the source code it represents instead of slowly drifting away from it.
