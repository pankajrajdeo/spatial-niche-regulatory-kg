# Introducing Deep Agents CLI

*By *[*Vivek Trivedy*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivek-trivedy-433509134/?ref=blog.langchain.com)

We're excited to introduce **Deep Agents CLI** for coding, research, and building agents with persistent memory. Now you can easily create and run custom Deep Agents directly from the terminal. It supports:

- **Read, write, and edit files** in your project
- **Execute shell commands** with human approval
- **Search the web** for current information
- **Make HTTP requests** to APIs
- **Learn and remember** information across sessions
- **Plan tasks** with visual todo lists

## Installation

`
uv tool install deepagents-cli

`

## Quick Start

### 1. Set Up Your API Keys

Deep Agents CLI supports any Large Language Model that supports tool calling. See [the docs](../deepagents/cli/providers.md) for details.

### 2. Launch the CLI

Start Deep Agents in your project directory:

`
deepagents

`

### 3. Your First Task

Try asking the agent to help with a simple task:

`
You: Add type hints to all functions in src/utils.py

`

The agent will:

1. Read the file
2. Analyze the functions
3. Show you a diff of proposed changes
4. Ask for your approval before writing

There's also an option to Auto-Accept Edits to speed up development

## Learning Through Memory

One of Deep Agents' most powerful features is its **persistent memory system**. The agent can learn information and recall it across sessions. Each agent stores its knowledge in `~/.deepagents/AGENT_NAME/memories/`:

By default, if you spin up Deep Agents it will create an agent with the name `agent` and use that by default. You can change the agent used (and therefor what memories are used) by specifying an agent name, eg `deepagents --agent foo`. See next section for more details.

The agent automatically follows a **Memory-First Protocol**:

1. **During Research** - Checks `/memories/` for relevant knowledge
2. **Before answering** - Searches memory files in case of uncertainty
3. **When learning** - Saves new information to `/memories/`

### Example: Teaching API Patterns

`
You: Remember that our API endpoints follow this pattern:
- Use /api/v1/ prefix
- All POST requests return 201 on success
- Error responses include a "code" and "message" field

Save this as our API conventions.

Agent: I'll save these API conventions to memory.
⚙ write_file(/memories/api-conventions.md)

`

Because this memory is persistent, the agent can use this information across future conversations.

`You: Create a new endpoint for user registration
Agent: Based on our API conventions, I'll create an endpoint at
/api/v1/users that returns 201 on success and follows
our error format.
⚙ read_file(/memories/api-conventions.md)
⚙ write_file(src/routes/users.py)

`

### Memory Best Practices

**1. Use descriptive filenames** ✓ /memories/deployment-checklist.md ✗ /memories/notes.md

**2. Organize by topic**

`/memories/
├── backend/

│ ├── tools_to_use.md

│ └── api-design.md

├── frontend/

│ ├── component-patterns.md

└── security-setup.md

`

**3. Verify saved knowledge** Because memory is just a set of files, you can always inspect and validate its content manually or with the agent.

`You: Check what you know about our database

Agent: Let me check my memories...
⚙ ls /memories/
⚙ read_file(/memories/backend/database-schema.md)

Based on my memory, we use PostgreSQL with these tables...

`

You can also inspect the memory files manually by just looking at `~/.deepagents/AGENT_NAME/memories/`

### Managing Multiple Agents

You can create specialized agents for different projects or roles: From the Deep Agents CLI you can list existing agents, create new agents, or reset an agent to its default state (system prompts, memories, etc).

`deepagents list

deepagents --agent backend-dev

deepagents reset backend-dev

`
