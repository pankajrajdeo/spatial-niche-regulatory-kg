# Generate a sandbox file download link

> Generate a tokenized link that downloads a single file from a sandbox with no further authentication. This mints a token rather than creating an addressable resource, so it returns 200 with no Location header. The token pins the sandbox, the file path, the response content type and disposition, and the sandbox flags, so a link cannot be repointed at another file or served under a weaker policy. The file is always served with a Content-Security-Policy: a sandbox directive, plus a default-src holding every fetch to the sandbox's own download host and a set of pre-approved third-party origins. csp_sandbox_flags may loosen the sandbox with allow-downloads, allow-forms, allow-modals, allow-orientation-lock, allow-pointer-lock, allow-popups, allow-presentation, allow-scripts, or allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation. allow-same-origin is not accepted, so a served file never shares an origin with anything. csp_source_bundles selects the third-party origins: cdnjs, google-fonts, jsdelivr, and unpkg are all allowed when the field is omitted, and 'none' holds the file to the sandbox alone. Because every file of one sandbox is served from the same host, a page can load sibling files it has links for, but only by their own link URLs. Links never expire unless expires_in_seconds is set. The link is served from the sandbox service domain, not the API host.

      summary: Generate a sandbox file download link
      description: >-
        Generate a tokenized link that downloads a single file from a sandbox
        with no further authentication. This mints a token rather than creating
        an addressable resource, so it returns 200 with no Location header. The
        token pins the sandbox, the file path, the response content type and
        disposition, and the sandbox flags, so a link cannot be repointed at
        another file or served under a weaker policy. The file is always served
        with a Content-Security-Policy: a sandbox directive, plus a default-src
        holding every fetch to the sandbox's own download host and a set of
        pre-approved third-party origins. csp_sandbox_flags may loosen the
        sandbox with allow-downloads, allow-forms, allow-modals,
        allow-orientation-lock, allow-pointer-lock, allow-popups,
        allow-presentation, allow-scripts, or
        allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation. allow-same-origin is not
        accepted, so a served file never shares an origin with anything.
        csp_source_bundles selects the third-party origins: cdnjs, google-fonts,
        jsdelivr, and unpkg are all allowed when the field is omitted, and
        'none' holds the file to the sandbox alone. Because every file of one
        sandbox is served from the same host, a page can load sibling files it
        has links for, but only by their own link URLs. Links never expire
        unless expires_in_seconds is set. The link is served from the sandbox
        service domain, not the API host.
