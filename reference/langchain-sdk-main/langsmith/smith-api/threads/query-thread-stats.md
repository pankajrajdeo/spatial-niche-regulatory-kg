# Query thread stats

> GET with body payload — no resources created. Returns aggregate statistics for threads in a tracing project.
The response includes the thread counts, run counts, latency percentiles, rates, token totals, and cost totals requested in `select`.

Self-hosted deployments require LangSmith `v0.17` or later.

            run. For numeric feedback this is the sample size behind `avg`,
            `min`, `max`, and `stdev`; for categorical feedback it is the sum of
            the `values` counts.

        sources:
          description: >-
            `sources` is a sample of feedback sources for this key. Each entry
            is either a plain string identifier (for example `"api"`, `"app"`,
            `"model"`) or a JSON object describing a synthetic source (for
            example `{"type": "__ls_composite_feedback"}` for a computed
            aggregate). Clients must tolerate both shapes.
          type: array
          items: {}
        stdev:
          description: >-
            `stdev` is the sample standard deviation of numeric feedback scores
            for this key on the run, or `null` when it cannot be computed (for
            example fewer than two numeric scores, or purely categorical
            feedback).
          type: number
          example: 0.05
        values:
          description: >-
            `values` is the distribution of categorical feedback labels for this
            key, mapping each label to its occurrence count. Empty (`{}`) for
            purely numeric feedback.
