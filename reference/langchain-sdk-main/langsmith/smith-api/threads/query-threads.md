        avg:
          description: >-
            `avg` is the arithmetic mean of numeric feedback scores for this key
            on the run, or `null` when no numeric score has been recorded (for
            example purely categorical feedback).
          type: number
          example: 0.87
        comments:
          description: >-
            `comments` is a sample of human-readable comments attached to
            feedback points for this key, in no particular order. May be empty;
            is not exhaustive when many comments exist.
          type: array
          items:
            type: string
          example:
            - good answer
            - needs citation
        contains_thread_feedback:
          description: >-
            `contains_thread_feedback` is true when at least one feedback point
            for this key was submitted at the thread level (rather than at an
            individual run). Always false on responses that already describe a
            single run in isolation.
          type: boolean
          example: false
        errors:
          description: >-
            `errors` is the number of feedback points recorded as errors rather
            than successful scores (for example an automated evaluator that
            raised an exception). Defaults to 0 when no errors occurred.
          type: integer
          default: 0
          example: 0
        max:
          description: >-
            `max` is the largest numeric feedback score recorded for this key on
            the run, or `null` when no numeric score has been recorded.
          type: number
          example: 0.95
        min:
          description: >-
            `min` is the smallest numeric feedback score recorded for this key
            on the run, or `null` when no numeric score has been recorded.
          type: number
          example: 0.8
        'n':
          description: >-
            `n` is the number of feedback points recorded for this key on the
            run. For numeric feedback this is the sample size behind `avg`,
            `min`, `max`, and `stdev`; for categorical feedback it is the sum of
            the `values` counts.
          type: integer
          example: 42
        sources:
          description: >-
            `sources` is a sample of feedback sources for this key. Each entry
            is either a plain string identifier (for example `"api"`, `"app"`,
            `"model"`) or a JSON object describing a synthetic source (for
            example `{"type": "__ls_composite_feedback"}` for a computed
            aggregate). Clients must tolerate both shapes.
          type: array
          items: {}
        stdev:
          description: >-
            `stdev` is the sample standard deviation of numeric feedback scores
            for this key on the run, or `null` when it cannot be computed (for
            example fewer than two numeric scores, or purely categorical
            feedback).
          type: number
          example: 0.05
        values:
          description: >-
            `values` is the distribution of categorical feedback labels for this
            key, mapping each label to its occurrence count. Empty (`{}`) for
            purely numeric feedback.
