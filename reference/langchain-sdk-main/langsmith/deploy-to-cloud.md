# Create a deployment

> Create a LangSmith Cloud deployment from the LangSmith UI or LangGraph CLI.

Create a Cloud deployment from a connected GitHub repository or directly from your local project. The LangSmith UI deploys from GitHub, while the `langgraph deploy` CLI builds and pushes from your local machine.

> [!NOTE]
> For a shorter walkthrough, see the [deployment quickstart](deployment-quickstart.md).

## Prerequisites

* A LangSmith account on the [Plus plan or above](https://www.langchain.com/pricing).
* An application that runs locally with `langgraph dev`. For more information, see [Local development and testing](local-dev-testing.md).

## Create a deployment

#### LangSmith UI
A GitHub organization owner or admin must authorize LangChain's `hosted-langserve` GitHub app once for the workspace. After authorization, any user with deployment permissions can create deployments from repositories that the app can access.

To create a deployment:

1. From the [LangSmith UI](https://smith.langchain.com?utm_source=docs\&utm_medium=cta\&utm_campaign=langsmith-signup\&utm_content=langsmith-deploy-to-cloud), select **Deployments**.
2. In the top-right corner, select **+ New Deployment**.
3. Select **Import from GitHub**, then complete the GitHub authorization flow if prompted.
4. Select a repository.
5. Enter a deployment name.
6. Select the **Git Branch** to deploy.
7. Enter the full path to the [LangGraph API configuration file](cli.md#configuration-file), including the file name. For example, enter `langgraph.json` if the file is in the repository root.
8. Choose whether to enable **Automatically update deployment on push to branch**. You can change this option later in [Deployment Settings](manage-deployment.md#configure-deployment-settings).
9. Select a deployment type:
   * **Serverless**: Works well for background, development, testing, and preview workloads. See [Serverless deployments](cloud-platform-features.md#serverless) for scale-to-zero availability.
   * **Dedicated**: Provides always-on infrastructure, high availability, and automatic database backups for production workloads.
10. Choose whether to make the deployment shareable through [Studio](studio.md).
11. Add environment variables and secrets. For more information, see [Environment variables](env-var-cloud.md).
12. Select **Submit**. LangSmith queues the deployment for provisioning and creates a tracing project with the same name.

> [!NOTE]
> The GitHub user who authorizes the `hosted-langserve` app must own the GitHub organization or account. Other users with deployment permissions do not need GitHub administrator access after the initial authorization.

#### LangGraph CLI
> [!NOTE]
> The `langgraph deploy` command is in [beta](release-stages.md). It requires Docker. On Apple silicon, it also requires Docker Buildx to cross-compile for `linux/amd64`.

To create a deployment:

1. Install the [LangGraph CLI](cli.md):

```shell
   uv tool install langgraph-cli
```

2. Add your LangSmith API key to a `.env` file in the project root:

```shell
   LANGSMITH_API_KEY=lsv2_...
```

3. Run:

```shell
   langgraph deploy
```

   The command creates a Serverless deployment named after the project directory. To set another name or deployment type, pass the corresponding options:

```shell
   langgraph deploy --name my-agent --deployment-type dedicated
```

> [!NOTE]
>        Organizations on previous pricing use `--deployment-type prod` or `--deployment-type dev` until October 1, 2026. For details, see [`langgraph deploy`](cli.md#deploy) and [Manage billing](billing.md#langsmith-deployment-billing).

LangSmith queues the deployment for provisioning. Manage environment variables through the LangSmith UI or the [`env` field in `langgraph.json`](cli.md#configuration-file).

## Manage GitHub repository access

After you authorize the `hosted-langserve` GitHub app, configure which repositories it can access:

1. In GitHub, go to **Settings** > **Applications**.
2. Find `hosted-langserve`, then select **Configure**.
3. Under **Repository access**, select **All repositories** or **Only select repositories**.
4. If you selected **Only select repositories**, add or remove repositories as needed.
5. Select **Save**.

The repository list in the **Create New Deployment** panel reflects the updated access.
