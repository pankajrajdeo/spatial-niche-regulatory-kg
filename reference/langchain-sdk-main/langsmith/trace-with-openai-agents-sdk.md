# Trace OpenAI Agents SDK applications

> Trace OpenAI Agents SDK Python and JavaScript applications with LangSmith.

The OpenAI Agents SDK lets you build agentic applications powered by OpenAI models.

Use LangSmith to trace OpenAI Agents SDK runs, including agent steps, model calls, tool calls, and handoffs.

#### Python
## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> Requires Python SDK version `langsmith>=0.3.15`.

Install LangSmith with OpenAI Agents support:

**pip**

```bash
pip install "langsmith[openai-agents]"
```

**uv**

```bash
uv add "langsmith[openai-agents]"
```

This installs both the LangSmith library and the OpenAI Agents SDK.

## Environment configuration

**Shell**

```bash
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>

# Optional: set a project for your traces
export LANGSMITH_PROJECT=<your-project-name>

# For LangSmith API keys linked to multiple workspaces, set the LANGSMITH_WORKSPACE_ID environment variable to specify which workspace to use.
export LANGSMITH_WORKSPACE_ID=<your-workspace-id>
```

## Quick start

Integrate LangSmith tracing with the OpenAI Agents SDK by using the `OpenAIAgentsTracingProcessor` class.

```python
import asyncio

from agents import Agent, Runner, set_trace_processors
from langsmith.integrations.openai_agents_sdk import OpenAIAgentsTracingProcessor

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        name="Captain Obvious",
        instructions="You are Captain Obvious, the world's most literal technical support agent.",
    )

    question = "Why is my code failing when I try to divide by zero? I keep getting this error message."
    result = await Runner.run(agent, question)
    print(result.final_output)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    set_trace_processors([OpenAIAgentsTracingProcessor()])
    asyncio.run(main())
```

The agent's execution flow, including spans and their details, is logged to LangSmith.

#### JavaScript
## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> Requires JS SDK version `langsmith>=0.5.25`.

Install LangSmith and the OpenAI Agents SDK:

**npm**

```bash
npm install langsmith @openai/agents zod
```

**yarn**

```bash
yarn add langsmith @openai/agents zod
```

**pnpm**

```bash
pnpm add langsmith @openai/agents zod
```

## Environment configuration

**Shell**

```bash
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>

# Optional: set a project for your traces
export LANGSMITH_PROJECT=<your-project-name>

# For LangSmith API keys linked to multiple workspaces, set the LANGSMITH_WORKSPACE_ID environment variable to specify which workspace to use.
export LANGSMITH_WORKSPACE_ID=<your-workspace-id>
```

> [!NOTE]
> Installing `OpenAIAgentsTracingProcessor` is an explicit opt-in to tracing. The processor posts traces even when `LANGSMITH_TRACING` is not set, and nested `traceable` calls inside agent tools inherit the active trace context.

## Quick start

Register `OpenAIAgentsTracingProcessor` with the OpenAI Agents SDK before running agents.

```typescript
import { Agent, run, setTraceProcessors, tool } from "@openai/agents";
import { z } from "zod";

import { OpenAIAgentsTracingProcessor } from "langsmith/wrappers/openai_agents";

setTraceProcessors([new OpenAIAgentsTracingProcessor()]);

const getWeather = tool({
  name: "get_weather",
  description: "Get the current weather for a city",
  parameters: z.object({
    city: z.string().describe("The city to get weather for"),
  }),
  execute: async ({ city }: { city: string }) => {
    return `The weather in ${city} is sunny.`;
  },
});

const agent = new Agent({
  name: "WeatherAgent",
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant. Use the get_weather tool when asked about weather.",
  model: "gpt-5-nano",
  tools: [getWeather],
});

const result = await run(agent, "What's the weather in San Francisco?");
console.log(result.finalOutput);
```

The resulting trace contains the root agent run, response spans, and nested tool call spans.

## Configure the processor

Pass options to the processor to set a LangSmith client, project, tags, metadata, or root trace name.

```typescript
import { Agent, run, setTraceProcessors } from "@openai/agents";

import { Client } from "langsmith";
import { OpenAIAgentsTracingProcessor } from "langsmith/wrappers/openai_agents";

const client = new Client();
const processor = new OpenAIAgentsTracingProcessor({
  client,
  projectName: "openai-agents-demo",
  name: "Support agent workflow",
  tags: ["openai-agents"],
  metadata: {
    environment: "development",
  },
});

setTraceProcessors([processor]);

const agent = new Agent({
  name: "SupportAgent",
  instructions: "You are a concise support agent.",
  model: "gpt-5-nano",
});

const result = await run(agent, "Help me reset my password.");
console.log(result.finalOutput);
```

## Nest `traceable` calls in tools

You can use `traceable` inside OpenAI Agents SDK tool handlers. LangSmith nests those runs under the active tool span.

```typescript
import { Agent, run, setTraceProcessors, tool } from "@openai/agents";
import { z } from "zod";

import { traceable } from "langsmith/traceable";
import { OpenAIAgentsTracingProcessor } from "langsmith/wrappers/openai_agents";

setTraceProcessors([new OpenAIAgentsTracingProcessor()]);

const lookupOrder = traceable(
  async (orderId: string) => {
    return { orderId, status: "shipped" };
  },
  { name: "lookup_order" }
);

const orderStatus = tool({
  name: "order_status",
  description: "Look up the status of an order",
  parameters: z.object({
    orderId: z.string().describe("The order ID to look up"),
  }),
  execute: async ({ orderId }: { orderId: string }) => {
    return JSON.stringify(await lookupOrder(orderId));
  },
});

const agent = new Agent({
  name: "OrdersAgent",
  instructions: "Use the order_status tool to answer order questions.",
  model: "gpt-5-nano",
  tools: [orderStatus],
});

await run(agent, "Where is order 123?");
```

## Flush traces in serverless environments

When tracing in serverless environments, flush pending traces before the process exits.

```typescript
import { Agent, run, setTraceProcessors } from "@openai/agents";

import { Client } from "langsmith";
import { OpenAIAgentsTracingProcessor } from "langsmith/wrappers/openai_agents";

const client = new Client();
const processor = new OpenAIAgentsTracingProcessor({ client });
setTraceProcessors([processor]);

try {
  const agent = new Agent({
    name: "SupportAgent",
    instructions: "You are a concise support agent.",
    model: "gpt-5-nano",
  });

  const result = await run(agent, "Help me reset my password.");
  console.log(result.finalOutput);
} finally {
  await processor.forceFlush();
}
```
